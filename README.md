* branch predictor - 
  design a branch predictor that can achieve max. accuracy given 32k+256 bits memory limit.
  achieved 95.4% using linear piecewise perceptron branch predictor.
  also tried Gshare, power4, bimode, skew, alpha and other predictors
* Cache Simulator - 
  Achieved a hit rate of 97.3% with direct mapped and 99.3% with 4-way set associative cache on given traces.
